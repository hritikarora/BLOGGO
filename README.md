# BLOGGO

Overview:

A basic blogging website in which users can create account and login to view bloggs written by others.
Users can also write their own blogs and publish in the website.

Some more things are required to be added in the website like some good interface to see blog page, and other section where users can view blogs written by them.

Technology used:

I have used html (for content), css (for styling), bootstrap (for making site interactive and also for good UI),
Javascript (for functioning part), java (for dealing with database i.e. backend part), jersey jax-rs (for Restful services), 
hibernate (for managing the backend part by mapping database with objects).
